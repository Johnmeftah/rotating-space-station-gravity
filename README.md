# Artificial Gravity in a Rotating Space Station

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes the forces acting on an astronaut inside a rotating donut-shaped space station, as viewed from both an inertial frame and the astronaut's rotating frame.

## Diagrams

The generated plot displays two frames:
- **Inertial Frame**: Shows the astronaut experiencing centripetal acceleration and the corresponding normal force.
- **Astronaut's Frame**: Shows the astronaut at rest, feeling an inward normal force balanced by an outward fictitious (centrifugal) force.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `matplotlib`

## How to Run

Clone the repo and run the script:

```bash
python artificial_gravity_diagram.py
```
